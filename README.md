# Hi! This is where I put my Java practice projects.

## Current projects:

## WordCount 
A java program that reads a text file and prints out the X most frequent words in alphabetical order. 

### How to run:

**first argument:** path to text file

**second argument:** number of top words

**example:**

java WordCount animals.txt 5

**expected output:**

rabbit (5), cat (4), dog (4), fox (3), bear (1)
